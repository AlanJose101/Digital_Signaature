Digital Signature
---------------------
What's a digital signature?
:easy to verify and hard to mimic
Digital signature is rely on Asymmetric encryption
RSA(type of asymmetric encryption)

A digital signature algorithm uses a public key system.
The Transmitter signs his/her message with his/her private key
The receiver will verify it with transmitters public key


What is Rsa Algorithm: is a asymmetric cryptographic algorithm
RSA is invented in 1978
It uses public and private key(Two different mathematically linked keys)
Public key - shared publicly
Private key - It's a secret key and must not share

How RSA Works?

The sender will encrypt the data into a cypher text
using the available public key and send the data to the
receiver. The receiver then decrypt the data with the
private key.

usage of "b" before the message

type(b"Message")
<class 'byte'>

If the message is in type str(String) then there will be a TypeError showing that the data must be bytes
Encryption algorithms need bytes to perform the operation
